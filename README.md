* LAB0 involves using shell commands.
* LAB1 involves creating our own command-line interpreter called myBash.
* LAB2 involves implementing a User-Space Semaphore System, serving as a synchronization mechanism among processes. This is then tested with a program.
* LAB3 involves studying the original scheduler functionality of xv6; analyzing the processes that benefit/suffer from this design decision; and finally, developing an implementation that improves this situation by replacing the scheduling policy with a custom one that must adhere to certain conditions.
* LAB4 involves completing part of the interface to enhance filesystem functionality. Additionally, we'll add functionalities that allow us to monitor activity within the filesystem transparently to the user.
